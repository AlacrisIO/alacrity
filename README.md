# Alacrity

Alacrity is a domain-specific language for trustworthy decentralized
applications. We use a cascading style of verification to
help establish trust by users, by allowing an application's
trusted code base to be very small,
while enabling the application to be deployed in a wide variety of contexts.
We will verify guarantees about program execution, compilation, correctness,
security, and efficiency. It uses a suite of verification methods,
like type theory, theorem proving, model checking, the strand spaces
method, and dynamical system simulation.

### Being worked on

You can watch on our [github repository](https://github.com/AlacrisIO/alacrity)
what we are currently working on.

As of June 2019, see notably the [compiler we are writing in Haskell](hs/alacrity/)
and the [Rock, Papers, Scissors demo](examples/rps-demo/) we are using as a benchmark application.
