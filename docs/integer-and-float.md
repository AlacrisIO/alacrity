[//]: # (title: Integer & Float)

## Integers

There is only one type of Integers supported at the moment,
`uint256`, which is a 256-bits unsigned integer type.
Alacrity provides the usual operations on integer data type as:
- Comparisons: `<=`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `>` (evaluate to bool)
- Bit operators: `&`, `|`, `^` (bitwise exclusive or), `~` (bitwise negation)
- Shift operators: `<< `(left shift), `>>` (right shift)
- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `unary -`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation)

## Floats

Float are not supported by the language.
