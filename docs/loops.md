[//]: # (title: Loops)

## Do Loops

Alacrity supports a very constrained form of loops.
What more, you must manually provide a loop invariant (and in the future, also a loop variant?).

The syntax and semantics are in flux and are not documented yet.
See an example of what is currently supported in the file `rps_while.ala` in our source code.
