[//]: # (title: Installation)

Alacrity is currently supported for native installation for Linux and MacOS.

# Bootstrap
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system with the versions
listed:
- `node` v12.4.0
- `npm` v6.9.0
- `stack` v2.1.3
- GNU `make` v4.1 (or greater)
- `geth` v1.9.2
- `z3` v4.8.5
- `solc` v0.5.2

We recommend you use
[`nvm` (node version manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update)
to install `node` and `npm`:
```bash
$ nvm install 12.4

# When swapping terminals or starting a fresh session you can ensure you're
# running the correct versions with:
$ nvm version
v8.2.0

$ nvm use 12.4
Now using node v12.4.0 (npm v6.9.0)
```

**Once you've situated `node` and `npm`, and any time the `package.json` file
has been modified, you'll need to ensure all pinned `node` dependencies have
been fetched for the project like so:**
```bash
$ npm clean-install
```


`stack` is similarly easy to install by following the directions
[here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install).

How you install GNU `make`, `geth`, `z3` and `solc` will depend on your OS.

### macOS users running homebrew
The GNU `make`
[package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make)
can be installed with:

```bash
$ brew install make
```

Follow the directions
[here](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum#installation)
to install `geth` and `solc`.

Homebrew also offers a `z3`
[package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/z3):

```bash
$ brew install z3
```

### macOS users running macports


```bash
$ sudo port install gmake gnutar wget cmake
```

Fetch pre-built `z3` + `geth` packages from the web and stage them in a `~/bin`
(or similar) directory:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/bin && cd ~/bin

$ wget https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases/download/Z3-4.8.5/z3-4.8.5-x64-osx-10.14.2.zip
$ wget https://gethstore.blob.core.windows.net/builds/geth-darwin-amd64-1.9.2-e76047e9.tar.gz

$ unzip z3-4.8.5-x64-osx-10.14.2.zip
$ gnutar -xvf geth-darwin-amd64-1.9.2-e76047e9.tar.gz

# Update ~/.bashrc (or ~/.profile, etc), substituting `<you>` with your
# username, so the new binaries become visible in your $PATH:
export PATH="/Users/<you>/bin/geth-darwin-amd64-1.9.2-e76047e9:$PATH"
export PATH="/Users/<you>/bin/z3-4.8.5-x64-osx-10.14.2/bin:$PATH"

# Activate the $PATH changes and verify the binaries are available now:
$ source ~/.bashrc

$ which geth
/Users/<you>/bin/geth-darwin-amd64-1.9.2-e76047e9/geth

$ which z3
/Users/<you>/bin/z3-4.8.5-x64-osx-10.14.2/bin/z3
```

Follow the build instructions
[here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.10/installing-solidity.html#prerequisites-macos)
and
[here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.10/installing-solidity.html#clone-the-repository)
to build `solc` from source.

# Tests
Invoke the following (in order) to run the test suite after you download our test DApp - Rock, Paper, Scissors from [here](https://github.com/AlacrisIO/alacrity/tree/master/examples/rps-auto):

```bash
# (Will clear previous network state and restart `geth` if already running)
$ make start_geth

# Wait a moment to allow `geth` to catch up...

# (Re-)compile the contract ABI + bytecode
$ make build

# Launch the test suite
$ make test

# Don't forget to shut down `geth` afterward so it's not taking up system
# resources unnecessarily
$ make stop_geth
```

*If `make test` fails with an `Error: Invalid JSON RPC response: undefined`
exception you should try again but wait a few moments between the
`run_ethereum` and `test` steps. The problem is that `geth` needs sufficient
time to launch the network before serving RPC requests.*

***Also note that you may need to replace `make` with `gmake` depending on your
setup.***


If you'd like to watch the progress of a pre-scripted game as it happens you
may also invoke:

```bash
$ make demo
```


# Linting
The JavaScript code under the `rps/` directory can also be style-checked with:

```bash
$ make lint
```

You won't see any output unless there are warnings and/or errors to report.

# Logs
To watch your private `geth` network's progress in real time you can invoke:

```bash
$ make logs
```
