{- Intermediate Language

   This language is the result of ANF. It is stratified so that all
   expressions receive simple arguments (constants or variables). The
   most complex thing is that consensus blocks have been transformed
   into binding by observing their continuation and embedding
   it.

   Another subtlety is that IF blocks embed their continuation, which
   means if an IF is not in tail position, then it duplicates the
   continuation. The ANF transform should track whether expressions
   are pure and turn them into ITE expressions to limit how much this
   occurs.

   This language is NOT guaranteed to be type-correct.

   It is essential that all participants agree on the number of times
   consensus is reached. This means that ANF has to do another complex
   job: it must ensure that IFs are consensual.

{- Backend Language

   These languages are the result of EPP. Like ANF, they are stratified,
   but there are two categories: one for the end-points (the
   participants) and one for the contract.

   Consensus blocks in IL are transformed into
   1. A receive from the contract in all participants.
   2. A send to the contract in the originator.
   3. A handler block in the contract.

   During EPP, the total number of consensus blocks are tracked and
   tagged with integers, so that all participants can agree on which
   block is going to run.
