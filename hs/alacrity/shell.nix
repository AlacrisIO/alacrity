# The above hack is necessary otherwise when you try to build
# language-javascript-0.6.0.12, happy-1.19.10 will fail to compile its grammar,
# while complaining in an under-informative:
#   happy: language-javascript-0.6.0.12/src/Language/JavaScript/Parser/Grammar7.y: hGetContents: invalid argument (invalid byte sequence)
# It turns out that a comment in this file contains the character "âˆ‰",
# as evidenced by:
#   tar zxf ~/.stack/indices/Hackage/packages/language-javascript/0.6.0.12/language-javascript-0.6.0.12.tar.gz
#   egrep '[^     -~]' language-javascript-0.6.0.12/src/Language/JavaScript/Parser/Grammar7.y
# However, nix doesn't include support for locales by default, so we have to tell it.

# This is definitely a bug in happy-1.19.10, possibly inherited from whatever
# library (or lack thereof) it uses to process text.
# Indeed, build tools MUST use the encoding specified by the programmer
# while processing a source file,
# with a well-defined default (strong suggestion: UTF-8).
# It is ABSOLUTELY NEVER appropriate to instead heed environment variables
# from the end-user who builds the software, that specify whichever encoding
# said end-user fancies while interacting with his windowing environment.
# Build error messages should use the very same default, unless explicitly
# overridden, e.g. by an interactive flag directing to use this locale.
