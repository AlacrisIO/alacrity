# Ethereum devnet

Your own local private copy of an Ethereum network.

_NB: This is not the shared Ethereum test network._

The scripts are:
  * `run.sh`: launches a private Ethereum network as a background process using
    "dev" mode, which provides a pre-funded account and begins mining.
  * `list-accounts.sh`: displays existing accounts.
