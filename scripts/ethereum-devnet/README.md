# Ethereum devnet

Your own local private copy of an ethereum network.
NB: This is not the shared ethereum test network.

The scripts here are:
  * run.sh : runs a private devnet as a background process using "dev" mode,
    which gives a pre-funded account and mines when transactions are created.
  * list-accounts.sh : displays existing accounts
