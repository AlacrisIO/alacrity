## About
This directory contains Docker configuration used for building images and running containers/services needed for the `alacrity` system to work in local Docker environments in a reliable and repeatable way.

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) images are created with `Dockerfile`s.
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) is used to describe the desired state of Alacrity services, thus implementing an Infrastructure as
Code (IaC) approach.

## Quick start
**Prerequisites:**
  - Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) minimum required version `17.12.0-ce`
  - Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) minimum required version `1.16.1`

#### Pull build and runtime prerequisites images:

```bash
$ make docker-pull
```
Check **docker-compose.yml** file for detailed service configuration.

#### List available containers
To list all containers run:
```bash
$ make docker-list
```
```
alacrity_geth
alacrity_demo
alacrity_prereq
alacrity_dev
```

#### Build app images
NOTE: We recommend pulling prebuilt images with previous command rather then building them from scratch to save time. 
```bash
$ make docker-build UID=$(id -u) GID=$(id -g)
```
To build a single image run command:
```bash
$ make docker-build c=container_name
```

#### Run containers
To run  containers run the command:
```bash
$ make docker-up c=container_name
```
NOTE: Check Makefile for details

## Containers
#### alacrity_prereq
This image is used to build  `alacrityc`  compiler and base image for `alacrity_dev` and `alacrity_demo` containers.

#### alacrity_demo
Runs tests and demo for RPS application.
To run `alacrity_dem`o container run the command:
```bash
$ make docker-up c=alacrity_demo
```
Example output:

#### alacrity_dev
This container is based on `alacrity_prereq` and runs `ghcid` in runtime. Useful for developing Haskell code since it will run `:reload` on every change in Haskell files.

To run `alacrity_dev` container run the command:
```bash
$ make docker-up c=alacrity_dev
```
Example output:
```
alacrity-dev       | Ok, 7 modules loaded.
alacrity-dev       | Loaded GHCi configuration from /tmp/haskell-stack-ghci/c3b9933a/ghci-script

```

#### alacrity_geth
This container will run as a dependecy for `alacrity_demo`. To build alacris private ethereum node run the command:
```bash
$ make docker-build c=alacrity_geth
```

## Connect into containers
As application user
```bash
$ docker exec -ti containername bash
```
As root user
```bash
$ docker exec -ti -u 0 containername bash
```

## Logs
Application logs that are not in `stdout` of running containers are for now
mounted in `/tmp/` on local machines until we agree on a final
destination.
